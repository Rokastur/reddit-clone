project made using Spring Boot, Hibernate and PostgreSQL. Uses Thymeleaf to render dynamic web pages.

#### features


Core feature are user made posts. Posts must belong to a category. Only authenticated users can create a new post or a
category. Each posts may have comments under it. Authenticated users have a profile, which is public for anyone to see. Users may upload a profile picture. 
A user may change the visibility of most of the content in their profile to private.

User profile displays profile picture, a description if they added one, number of posts and comments written by them,
how many upvotes their posts and comments have received, account creation date;
also, displays their posts, comments, followed categories and bookmarked reviews.

If user sets their profile to private (incognito), most of the information gets hidden from other users.

Most of the content - categories, posts, comments can be ordered by number of criteria, such as date, score, etc. 

UI is rudimentary.
